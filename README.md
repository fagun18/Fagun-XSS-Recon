To use xss0rRecon effectively, it's essential that all required files are downloaded and placed in the same folder. Follow the instructions below to get started.
üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions:

    Download the necessary files:
        Visit https://store.xss0r.com

The license details are listed on store.xss0r.com on the popup and will remain active only during this period. After the 15th, the license will expire.

If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to reach out to me.

Additional notes (Arjun dependency):

    xss0rRecon uses Arjun for parameter discovery. The script now auto-detects Arjun via the arjun binary or python -m arjun.

    If you see an error like: cannot execute: required file not found
        Install Arjun with one of the following:
            pip3 install arjun
            # or on Debian/Ubuntu
            sudo apt install arjun

    After installation, simply re-run xss0rRecon. The script will pick up whichever Arjun form is available.
